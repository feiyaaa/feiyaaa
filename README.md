- Hi, I’m Fia! ❤︎
- I'm an 18 year old Biochem student from the Netherlands.
- My personal OS is Linux Mint, but I often use Ubuntu for building.
- I mainly work in Python, Rust and C#.
- Most of my contributions are hopefully going to be on Monika After Story or MAS Submods, but I'd love to help in whatever way I can!
